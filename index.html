      Your opinion has been submitted

    <p>
      Think about the following things now that you have expressed your opinion:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Do you know where this will be saved?</li>
      <li>Did you feel like you had no power to dictate where your information goes?</li>
      <li>Did you know that you just contributed to the online personality that I (a bot) am constructing?</li>
      <li>Did you ever think I could access your Facebook login to share it as you on Facebook (I don't).</li>
    </ul>

    <strong>This could have very well been a status on Facebook or an email that you send out.
      There is so much data out there it is important to know how easy it is to duplicate everything. Similarly
      remember that this is a purposefully mysterious black box to make you feel like you have no say where this data
      goes.</strong>

    <p> Be safe out there!</p>

      <i>Have you ever thought of how many bots you interact with online?</i><br>

      <p>
        This was built for a class that explores how technology has an impact in our world today. There are two main
        points.
      </p>

      <h5>You are a grain of sand</h5>

      <p>
        To the internet this opinion is almost nothing. I try to highlight the fact that it's so easy to share
        content and media these days. But more importantly, the fact that you have no idea where your opinion or ideas
        can end up. For all you know it is somewhere on the internet to be kept for centuries.
      </p>

      <h5>You're opinion is now mine</h5>

      <p>
        The other aspect of this project highlights the fact that everything you are saying I am sharing as MY (a
        robot)
        opinion. I am uncreatively putting together a personality - a narrative - that all my social media followers
        are building.
      </p>
